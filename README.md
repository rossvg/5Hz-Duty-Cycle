# 5Hz-Duty-Cycle
Arduino outputs a 5hz duty cycle. Useful for debugging and using certain components requiring a duty cycle.

# Setup
Ensure voltage bounds are consistent with the board model. Ouput pin is arbitrarily assigned to pin 9.

# Usage
Upload to board and run. Tested with oscilloscope and probe at pin 9. Program can be tweaked to any duty cycle. Helpful for generating signals with Arduino.

# Final Notes
Possibly transfrom into a full-fledged, user friendly, signal/waveform generator.
